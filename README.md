1. Used Python to construct data pipelines based on PostgREST to retrieve and preprocess data from PgSQL for SVR modeling. (Improved speed by at least 800\%)
2. Developed a RESTful API for retrieving GeoJSON data using postgREST under Springboot Framework. Implemented endpoints for fetching data based on trace IDs, time range, and bounding box, enabling flexible and efficient retrieval of GeoJSON data from the database; kept clear documentation to ensure seamless integration and facilitate usage and understanding.
